Hi [Name],

I noticed you're in B2B sales at [Company]. How do you currently track companies for sales signals like funding rounds or hiring sprees?

Most sales teams I talk to either:
1. Pay $1,250+/month for ZoomInfo
2. Manually search news/LinkedIn (and miss opportunities)

That's why I built SignalFox - AI-powered sales intelligence that's 90% cheaper.

SignalFox automatically tracks companies for:
• Funding rounds (who just raised money)
• Hiring sprees (who's growing fast)  
• Expansion announcements (who's entering new markets)
• Leadership changes (new decision makers)

Our AI analyzes these signals and sends you real-time alerts, so you can reach out at the perfect moment.

Pricing:
• Starter: $99/month (50 companies)
